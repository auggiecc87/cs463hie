In order to run any of the queries you are going to need to run:
ssh -f -L 3307:127.0.0.1:3306 cs463@lisa.acm.uiuc.edu sleep 60 >> logfile_cs463

to open a SSH tunnel to the datastore.

Individual MySQL queries could be tested via:
mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307

Then by pointing a webserver with PHP and MCRYPT for PHP loaded on it you can 
use the web interface we have created.

We have setup our machines by pointing Apache to the hisp_cs463 or phr_cs463 i
directory depending on which view we wanted to test.

UPDATE:

In Phase II we need to have seperate Keystore and Datastore
to do so we need two seperate ssh tunnels which can be run as:

bash keystore.bash
bash phr_hisp_tunnel.bash

Furthermore the keystore mysql database can only be accessed at
128.174.73.21/myadmin only on the campus network (VPN/illinoisnet/ethernet)
